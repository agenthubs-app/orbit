# Orbit App Agent Rules

This directory is the iOS-first Orbit mobile app.

- Edit only files inside `repos/orbit-app` when implementing mobile app tasks.
- Do not import source files from `../orbits`; use HTTP APIs exposed by `repos/orbits`.
- Do not read or write Postgres, Supabase, `orbit_records`, or browser localStorage from the mobile app.
- Keep user-facing copy free of implementation labels such as mock, hybrid, provider, or command-center.
- Do not commit `.expo/`, `node_modules/`, simulator output, screenshots, native build artifacts, or generated logs.
- If a mobile screen needs missing backend behavior, document the API gap instead of duplicating business logic locally.
